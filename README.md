# ðŸ§­ DFS-BFS Maze Visualizer

An interactive 2D maze visualizer built with **TypeScript**, showcasing the step-by-step process of **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms. This project offers an educational and visually engaging way to understand how these algorithms navigate through a maze.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** 
- **HTML**   
- **CSS**
- Built with **React** and CSS Grid for layout and animation

## ðŸ”‘ Features

- Random maze generation with walls  
- Clearly marked start and end points  
- DFS and BFS pathfinding visualizations  
- Smooth step-by-step animations  
- Clear maze without regeneration to compare algorithms  
- Responsive and intuitive UI


## ðŸ§  How It Works
## Maze Generation
- A grid of customizable size is generated.
- Walls are placed at random positions while keeping the start and end cells open.
- The maze ensures the possibility of a solvable path, although no path is guaranteed due to randomness.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
- DFS explores the maze by diving deep into one branch before backtracking.
- Implemented using recursion or a stack.
- May not find the shortest path, but it's fast and efficient for exploring deep solutions.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- BFS explores all neighboring nodes level by level.
- Implemented using a queue.
- Always finds the shortest path (if one exists).

## Visualization
- As the algorithm runs, each visited node is highlighted step-by-step.
- Once the end node is found, the final path is traced and shown with a distinct color.
- Animations clearly distinguish between exploration and final path.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started
